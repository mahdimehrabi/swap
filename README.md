## Setup 
```
cp env.example .env
```
config environment variables in .env 

run migrations
```
make db-migrate-up
```

run seeder
```
 make db-seed
```
### Extra features
### Used in memory db (redis) for storing prices
### Used cassandra db for best scalability because our entities do not have a complex relational
### Created arbitrary precision currency types for strong currency values and avoid floating point inaccuracies
### Implemented worker pool for getting price from API on the background along with rate limiter
### Seeder 
### Error for swap event if a token price is not updated recently

### Please consider
#### I know ORM has negative effect on performance, but I think for test project ORM is good enough.
